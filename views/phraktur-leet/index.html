          <div class="caption">In August 2014, independent game designer Zoe Quinn became the target of a highly-coordinated harassment campaign mounted by gamers angered by the favorable reviews garnered by Quinn’s “Depression Quest,” a text-based game designed to convey the experience of depression through a series of fictional scenarios based in part on the author’s experience. Taking issue with the game’s “politics” and in the guise of defending the ethics of gaming journalism, these gamers organized across Reddit, 4chan, and IRC channels to dox, hack, and threaten Quinn en masse, resulting in them having to leave their home for fear of attack. These strategies were then adopted to harass other non-men in gaming spaces such as Anita Sarkeesian, a media critic covering women in games. This controversy came to be known as GamerGate, after the hashtag used in its coordination, and marked what is considered to be the first large spark in today’s culture wars.

          <div class="caption">In October 2015, Breitbart News Network placed British far-right polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos in charge of its new “Breitbart Tech” section. Yiannopoulos had joined Breitbart in 2014; when GamerGate erupted, he used his platform to become a lead actor in the movement as one of its most vocal supporters. Yiannopoulos employed GamerGate as a basis for online attacks on women, and his role in GamerGate allowed him to become one of the central figures in the mainstream growth of the alt-right.

          <div class="caption">Donald Trump announced his bid for the presidency in 2015 and was quickly adopted by the alt-right as their champion. Using the same channels that fostered and supported GamerGate, the alt-right became one of Trump’s most vocal supporters, and because of their unilateral backing of Trump, voters previously unaware of the alt-right or of gamer spaces flocked to the movement. Journalist David Niewert observed that "Trump was the gateway drug for the alt-right,” with many individuals learning of the movement through their interest in Trump.

          <div class="caption">In August 2017, the Unite the Right rally took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, bringing together alt-right activists with members of other white supremacist and far-right movements. Many alt-rightists thought that the rally would mark a turning point in the transformation of their movement from an online phenomenon into a street-based one. However, the rally and its aftermath, in which many participants faced personal and legal repurcussions, demoralized many who held less extreme views. The movement fragmented along those lines, but not before “alt-right” became a mainstream term under which virulent white nationalism could operate.

      <div class="about-text">
        <div class="para">Phraktur 1337 as a variable font is a visual metaphor that structurally connects gamer culture and white nationalism. At its base, it’s a Fraktur, referring to the use of Fraktur by the Alt-Right, especially in Germany where it hearkens back to Nazi Aryan nationalism. The interpolation axis—instead of increasing weight or width—turns the Latin into Leet and back. Leet is a system of modified spellings that uses orthography as gatekeeping, substituting letters with homoglyphs constructed using numbers, punctuation, and other letters to visually represent them. Leet originated in 1980s hacker bulletin board systems, where it first served a cryptographic function by making it difficult to text-search for indicators of illegal practices. Leet was soon adopted by the gaming community, where its base vocabulary and grammar expanded to include things like “pwned” for trash talk, like “we pwned the other team,” or “n00b,” used to disparage newbies.</div>
        <div class="para">As a visual metaphor, Phraktur Leet’s interpolation is (intentionally) messy and fragmented before coalescing into a whole on either end. The fragmentation that happens in between illustrates how the mainstream public couldn’t draw a line between gamer culture and white nationalism, possibly because of the way their harassment campaigns were coordinated across fragmented and decentralized channels. And even when the typeface is “clean” on either end of the interpolation, the Latin is a super display that works poorly at smaller sizes, and leet orthography is intentionally difficult to read, reflecting the illegibility of online gamer and alt-right spaces to the general public.</div>

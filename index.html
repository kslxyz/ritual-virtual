            <p>The Ammerman Center for Arts and Technology at Connecticut College is pleased to announce <i>RITUAL/VIRTUAL: Technologies of Here, There, and Thereafter</i>, a group exhibition curated by 2021–2022 Ammerman Visiting Fellow Kit Son Lee. Featuring work by Herdimas Anggara, Neta Bomani, Songan Kyung, and Kit Son Lee, <i>RITUAL/VIRTUAL</i> presents engagements with technology that straddle the sacred and the mundane, the spiritual and the secular, the historic and the contemporary. Through explorations of (sub)cultural cycles and machinic loops, these works unearth the repetitions encoded in our devices to examine, complicate, and undermine their influence on social conditions.</p>

            <p>Ritual can be sacred (e.g. a ritual ceremony) or mundane (e.g. a daily ritual), but both valences are defined by repetition. The recurring loop characterizes much of modern technology, and advances are often measured by the automation of previously manual tasks. With sociopolitical infrastructure becoming increasingly dependent on these conveniences, we find ourselves participating—knowingly or not—in rituals of another’s design. In light of this trajectory, <i>RITUAL/VIRTUAL</i> collapses sacrosanct themes into everyday interfaces. The presented works contend with consumer technologies at the level of religion, culture, economics, and time, challenging their supposed banality with rites of their own making.</p>

            <div class="descrip-text">Enter the Bardo explores the concept of the “bardo,” a liminal or transitional state between death and rebirth found in some schools of Buddhism. Kyung Identifies Saṃsāra—the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth—as sharing the loop structure of video games, in which players can repeatedly die, only to return to rechallenge the mission. Filmed in a single shot within a game engine-generated white cube, Enter the Bardo appropriates the Z-axis centered perspective of first person shooters to allow audiences to experience the Bardo from the viewpoint of the dead.</div>

                <p>In a self-reflexive, multilevel narrative, Kyung’s True Story examines the creation and distribution of conspiracy theories, the manufacturing of belief, and the profit motives of their makers. The installation recreates the home office of Pickle Juice, a fictional game developer, streamer, and owner of the business Brotherhood Squirrel Pest Control. Pickle Juice himself appears on the computer monitor, where a stream of his “Let’s Play” walks viewers through an indie horror-adventure puzzle game titled True Story, which had ostensibly been sent by an anonymous source. The viewer follows along as Pickle Juice unearths a series of unsettling clues, spiraling deeper and deeper into a web of dark secrets until he discovers their villainous root: squirrels.</p>

                <p>Though the reveal might be an obvious Brotherhood business ploy, Pickle Juice’s expert wielding of narration and reaction transforms the streamer into a charismatic authority capable of intensifying fictive fearmongering into a real-world threat. Through Pickle Juice’s multiple personas, Kyung’s True Story models a larger online ecosystem of content creators, distributors, and social media algorithms, investigating the recursive engine of “truth”-generation behind many of today’s most bitter political divisions.</p>
